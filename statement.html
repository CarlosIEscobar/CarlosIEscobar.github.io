  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>Hello all! my name is Carlos Escobar aka Izaya Karurosu. I'm currently a Creative Arts student at SJSU and right now I'm exploring the realm of video art! As for my content, I like to create projects that mean something to me and hopefully allows my audience to conjure questions about what it is they're seeing. I may not be the best at editing or making quality videos, but these are videos i enjoyed making for everyone.</p>
  <p>When it comes to my creative process, I like to focus on topics I enjoy and mix multiple into one project. Basically, I'm showing whoever observes my content a part of me. As a person, I prefer not to be tied to one thing, so I like to use art as a way to explore various genres in a meaningful way. Personnaly I like to include metaphors in my artwroks that correspond with nature and the feeling it provides to different people. People typically observe nature differently, so I hope to have the same affect on people with my content.
